**core: a local-first personal growth book**

Core is a journaling app built with **Tauri**, **Rust**, and **TypeScript**.  
Each day gets its own structured journal page with six sections:

- Today’s Schedule  
- To-Do  
- Goals  
- Motivation  
- Happiness (1–10 slider)  
- Daily Journal

Everything is stored **locally** in a SQLite database

To run:
1. Install dependencies using `npm install`
2. Start the app in development mode with `npm run tauri dev`
3. The SQLite database is created automatically on first launch
